# CycleGAN

Tensorflow implementation for cyclegan, "Alien:Covenant" is used to distinguish it from other tensorflow implementations.
The method is proposed by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~junyanz/) in 
[Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networkssee](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf).

# Reference

[CycleGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow) The best tensorflow implementation of cyclegan,I think, and I use its training and test module,while I write G and D myself.

## Getting Started

### Train
- Download a dataset (e.g. zebra and horse images from ImageNet):
```bash
bash ./download_dataset.sh horse2zebra
```
- Train a model:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=horse2zebra
```
- Use tensorboard to visualize the training details:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
```

### Test
- Finally, test the model:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=horse2zebra --phase=test --which_direction=AtoB
```

## Training and Test Details
To train a model,  
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/ 
```
Models are saved to `./checkpoints/` (can be changed by passing `--checkpoint_dir=your_dir`).  

To test the model,
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/ --phase=test --which_direction=AtoB/BtoA
```

## Datasets
Download the datasets using the following script:
```bash
bash ./download_dataset.sh dataset_name
```
- `facades`: 400 images from the [CMP Facades dataset](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/).
- `cityscapes`: 2975 images from the [Cityscapes training set](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
- `maps`: 1096 training images scraped from Google Maps.
- `horse2zebra`: 939 horse images and 1177 zebra images downloaded from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) using keywords `wild horse` and `zebra`.
- `apple2orange`: 996 apple images and 1020 orange images downloaded from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) using keywords `apple` and `navel orange`.
- `summer2winter_yosemite`: 1273 summer Yosemite images and 854 winter Yosemite images were downloaded using Flickr API. See more details in our paper.
- `monet2photo`, `vangogh2photo`, `ukiyoe2photo`, `cezanne2photo`: The art images were downloaded from [Wikiart](https://www.wikiart.org/). The real photos are downloaded from Flickr using combination of tags *landscape* and *landscapephotography*. The training set size of each class is Monet:1074, Cezanne:584, Van Gogh:401, Ukiyo-e:1433, Photographs:6853.
- `iphone2dslr_flower`: both classe of images were downlaoded from Flickr. The training set size of each class is iPhone:1813, DSLR:3316. See more details in our paper.
